            Coronary artery disease is a common heart condition that affects the major blood vessels that supply the
            heart muscle. Cholesterol deposits (plaques) in the heart arteries are usually the cause of coronary artery
            disease. The buildup of these plaques is called atherosclerosis (ath-ur-o-skluh-ROE-sis). Atherosclerosis
            reduces blood flow to the heart and other parts of the body. It can lead to a heart attack, chest pain
            (angina) or stroke.

            Coronary artery disease symptoms may be different for men and women. For instance, men are more likely to
            have chest pain. Women are more likely to have other symptoms along with chest discomfort, such as shortness
            of breath, nausea and extreme fatigue.

            You might not be diagnosed with coronary artery disease until you have a heart attack, angina, stroke or
            heart failure. It's important to watch for heart symptoms and discuss concerns with your health care
            provider. Heart (cardiovascular) disease can sometimes be found early with regular health checkups.

            The heart has four valves â€” the aortic, mitral, pulmonary and tricuspid valves. They open and close to move
            blood through the heart. Many things can damage the heart valves. A heart valve may become narrowed
            (stenosis), leaky (regurgitation or insufficiency) or close improperly (prolapse).

            Valvular heart disease is also called heart valve disease. Depending on which valve isn't working properly,
            heart valve disease symptoms generally include:

            Always call 911 or emergency medical help if you think you might be having a heart attack.

            Heart disease is easier to treat when detected early. Talk to your health care provider if you have any
            concerns about your heart health. Together, you and your provider can discuss ways to reduce your heart
            disease risk. This is especially important if you have a family history of heart disease.

            If you think you may symptoms of heart disease, make an appointment to see your provider.
